# Analysis.of.Merge.and.Insertion.Sort.Algorithms

* Implemented both merge and insertion sort algorithms from scratch.
* Gained insight into Divide and Conquer strategy for algorithm design.
* Calculated upper boundary (Big O) time complexity of both algorithms.
* Tested both algorithms with increasingly larger sets of numbers and charted their logarithmic sort times over set size.
* Self analyzed theoretical results with actual output.
* The chart for insertion sort closely resembled O(n^2) whereas merge sort resembled O(n log n).
* Outcome: theoretical time complexity for both algorithms was achieved.
